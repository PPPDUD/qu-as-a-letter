Why Qu should replace Q as a letter

# The legacy of Q
Q is an interesting letter. All true English words use Q as in QU (ie., quack, quick, quantum), and the foreign words (ie., Iraq and Qi) almost always use Q as a K.

As a result, I propose that Q be replaced with QU and K, respectively.

# The effects of QU
QU will be an excellent new letter. Instead of having to move your fingers 5 keys right, you can just use one key.
Foreign words will be reformed to use K instead, further simplifying the spelling and pronunciation of such words.
